# stat-bot

Keeps track of all kind of stats

## Usage

If you want the bot to join your server,
go to <https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?&client_id=269802184571486218&scope=bot> and confirm your server.

If you want to modify the bot, you should start by cloning this repo & installing the npm modules.

## Setup

After you cloned the repo, running `npm install` from your CLI should install all dependencies.

Next, you should enter your configuration options into a file called `config.json` in the root directory.
You can use the file `config.default.json` as a starting point

After you've done that, running `node index.js` will start the bot.
